## General

https://discordjs.guide has nearly everything one could possibly want to know about DiscordJS.

[Updating from v12 to v13](https://discordjs.guide/additional-info/changes-in-v13.html)

It seems like only messages responding to interactions can be ephemeral, but you can still attach the ephemeral property and not break anything even if not responding to an interaction.

## Intents

for discord.js v13 (and by extension, Discord API v8), intents are required on initialization.

List of intents can be found here: https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#list-of-intents

discord.js intents class docs: https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Intents

## Slash Commands

When responding to the slash commands, it looks like a reply is needed or else it will say the interaction failed?
