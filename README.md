# GunrockJS

I hate discord python it makes me sad and there is so little documentation so im trying to implement Gunrock in JS.

## General Features

To get started, try running `/gunrock` in any discord server with the bot!

Use the commands `/course` and `/crn` to get data on any UC Davis course!

## Moderation Features

Each command can be enabled/disabled server wide!

Note: This only works with regular commands (i.e. you won't be able to do this via slash commands).

To see all commands and their settings, run `[prefix] settings list`

To enable/disabled commands, run `[prefix] settings set [command name] enabled [true/false]`

## Development Quickstart

(Run only once): `npm install`

Watch: `npm run watch`

Run without watch: `node .`
